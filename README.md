# 1.Data Collection: 
The first step is to collect a dataset of chest X-ray images that includes both COVID-19 positive and negative cases. You can find such datasets on platforms like Kaggle, and the link you provided seems to be a dataset of COVID-19 chest X-ray images.

# 2.Data Preprocessing:
Once you have the dataset, you need to preprocess the images to make them suitable for training the model. Common preprocessing steps include resizing the images to a uniform size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data (flipping, rotating, zooming) to increase the diversity of the training set.

# 3.Splitting the Data: 
Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting, and the testing set evaluates the final model's performance.

# 4.Building the Model:
You can create an image classification model using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image recognition tasks. CNNs consist of convolutional layers that learn features from the input images and fully connected layers for classification.

# 5.Training the Model:
Train the CNN using the training dataset. The model learns to recognize patterns and features in the chest X-ray images that distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative cases. This process involves forward and backward propagation to update the model's parameters to minimize the prediction error.

# 6.Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning: 
After training the model, evaluate its performance using the validation dataset. Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of layers, batch size) to improve the model's accuracy without overfitting.

# 7.Testing the Model:
Once the model is fine-tuned and has achieved satisfactory performance on the validation set, evaluate its performance on the testing dataset to get an unbiased estimate of its accuracy.
# 8.Deployment: 
After successfully training and testing the model, you can deploy it as an application or integrate it into a healthcare system where it can be used to classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19 positive or negative.
# RESULT:
Proposed CNN model achieves 91% accuracy in X-ray image classification, effectively detecting
COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia cases with high precision.
